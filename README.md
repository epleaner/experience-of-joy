# What does joy feel like for you?

In the body, in the mind, in the heartspace? Does it have a color? A texture? A temperature? A taste? A sound?

## Explore how you and others experience this universal humanness.

## Development

1. Clone this repo!
2. You'll need to create a MongoDB Atlas collection (free), and then add the `MONGODB_DB` and `MONGODB_URI` environment variables to `.env.local` in the project root.
3. Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
